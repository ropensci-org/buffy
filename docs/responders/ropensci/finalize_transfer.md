ROpenSci :: Finalize transfer
=============================

This responder is used to assing a recent approved and transfered package to a rOpenSci team. It needs owner rights to work.
It performs a series of tasks:

- Checks for the presence of the package-name repo in the rOpenSci GitHub organization
- Creates a new team named like the package-name and invites the creator of the issue to it, if the team does not exists already.
- Adds the package-name repo to the package-name team with admin rights so the members of the team can manage it
