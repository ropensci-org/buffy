ROpenSci :: Reviewers & due date
================================

This responder can be used to add/remove a user to/from the reviewers list in the body of the issue. It also sets a due date for the review and updates that info in the body of the issue and in the reply comment. This responder will also update Airtable adding entries to the reviewers and reviews tables, and creating if still not present entries in the packages and authors tables.
Allows [labeling](../../labeling), that will take effect when the second reviewer is assigned.

## Listens to

```
@botname add @username to reviewers
```
```
@botname remove @username from reviewers
```

## Requirements

The body of the issue should have a couple of placeholders marked with HTML comments: the _reviewers-list_ and the _due-dates-list_

```html
<!--reviewers-list-->  <!--end-reviewers-list-->
<!--due-dates-list-->  <!--end-due-dates-list-->
```

## Settings key

`ropensci_reviewers`

## Params
```eval_rst
:due_date_days: *<Integer>* Optional. The number of days from the moment a reviewer is assigned to the due date for the review. Default value is **21** (three weeks).

:sample_value:  Optional. A sample value string for the username field. It is used for documentation purposes when the :doc:`Help responder <../help>` lists all available responders. Default value is **xxxxx**.

:no_reviewer_text: Optional. The text that will go in the removed reviewer place to state there's no one assigned. Default value is **TBD**.

:add_as_assignee: *<Boolean>* Optional. If true, the new reviewer will be added as assignee to the issue. Default value is **false**.

:add_as_collaborator: *<Boolean>* Optional. If true, the new reviewer it will be added as collaborator to the repo. Default value is **false**.

:reminder: Used to configure automatic reminders. See next.
```

Automatic reminders: To configure an automatic reminder for the reviewers the `reminder` param can be used with two nested options under it:
```eval_rst
:days_before_deadline: *<Integer>* Optional. Configure when the reminder will be posted (how many days before the dealine for the review). Default value: **4**

:template_file: The template file to use for the reminder (will receive variables: *reviewer*, *days_before_deadline* and *due_date*).
```

For the **Airtable** connection to work two parameters must be present in the `env` section of the settings file, configured using environment variable:
```yaml
...
  env:
    airtable_api_key: <%= ENV['AIRTABLE_API_KEY'] %>
    airtable_base_id: <%= ENV['AIRTABLE_BASE_ID'] %>
...
```

## Examples

**Simplest case:**
```yaml
...
  responders:
    ropensci_reviewers:
...
```

**With labeling, changing no_reviewer_text, setting a reminder, limiting access and only if there's an editor already assigned:**
```yaml
...
  responders:
    ropensci_reviewers:
      only:
        - editors
      if:
        role_assigned: editor
      no_reviewer_text: "Pending"
      add_labels:
        - 3/reviewer(s)-assigned
      remove_labels:
        - 2/seeking-reviewer(s)
      reminder:
        days_before_deadline: 4
        template_file: reminder.md
...
```
